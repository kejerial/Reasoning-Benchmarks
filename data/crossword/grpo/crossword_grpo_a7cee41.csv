"Achy shaking stopped by iodine, salt and kaolin","chinaclay","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@a7cee41","<think>
The clue mentions ""achy shaking,"" which could refer to a physical sensation or condition. ""Stopped by iodine, salt and kaolin"" suggests that these substances are used to treat or alleviate the condition. Iodine is often used in antiseptics, salt is a common ingredient in many remedies, and kaolin is a clay used in medicine for its soothing properties.

The condition ""achy shaking"" could be related to a fever, as fevers often cause shivering and aches. The substances mentioned (iodine, salt, and kaolin) are often used in treatments for fevers, such as in a tepid sponge bath.

Given the 9-letter requirement, the word that fits the description of a fever symptom treated with these substances is ""CHILLS.""

"Paid the bail for a sound woman","freda","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@a7cee41","<think>
The clue ""Paid the bail for a sound woman"" is cryptic. Let's break it down:

1. ""Paid the bail"" suggests a legal context, where ""bail"" is the amount of money paid to secure the release of a person from custody.
2. ""For a sound woman"" is the tricky part. ""Sound"" can mean healthy or intact, but it can also be a homophone for ""son."" ""Woman"" is straightforward.

Given the 5-letter requirement, let's consider:
- ""Paid the bail"" could be ""PAID.""
- ""For a sound woman"" could be ""SON"" (a homophone for ""sound"") and ""WOMAN.""

Combining these, we get ""PAID"" and ""SONWOMAN."" The word ""SONWOMAN"" is not a real word, but we can rearrange the letters to fit the 5-letter requirement.

The word ""SONWOMAN"" can be rearranged to form ""SOUND,"" which fits the 5-letter requirement and makes sense in the context of the clue.

"In Germany, thin girls can eat this!","anything","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@a7cee41","<think>
The clue mentions ""Germany"" and ""thin girls can eat this."" This suggests a food item. The word ""thin"" could be a hint towards a wordplay or an anagram. The phrase ""can eat this"" is a direct clue to the food item.

Let's consider the word ""thin"" in the context of anagrams. ""Thin"" can be rearranged to form ""hint."" This could be a key to the solution.

The food item in Germany that is often associated with being ""thin"" is ""pretzel."" Pretzels are a common snack in Germany, and they can be ""thin"" in form.

Let's check if ""pretzel"" fits the clue:
- ""In Germany"" - Yes, pretzels are a common snack in Germany.
- ""thin girls can eat this"" - Pretzels are a snack that can be eaten by anyone, including thin girls.

So, the word ""pretzel"" fits the clue perfectly.

"Turns up in chilly surroundings yet well received","popular","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@a7cee41","<think>
The clue ""Turns up in chilly surroundings yet well received"" suggests a word that is commonly found in cold environments but is also appreciated or well-received. Let's break it down:

1. ""Turns up in chilly surroundings"" implies the word is something that is often found in cold places.
2. ""Yet well received"" suggests the word is also something that is liked or appreciated.

Given these hints, let's consider some possibilities:
- ""Snow"" is often found in cold places and is generally well-received, but it's not 7 letters.
- ""Ice"" is also found in cold places and is well-received, but again, it's not 7 letters.
- ""Frost"" is a word that can be found in cold environments and is often appreciated, but it's only 5 letters.
- ""Freezer"" is a place where things are kept cold, but it's not 7 letters.
- ""Chill"" is a word that can describe coldness and is well-received, but it's only 5 letters.

After considering these, the word ""FROSTED"" seems to fit the clue perfectly:
- ""FROST"" is found in cold surroundings.
- ""TED"" is an anagram of ""TED,"" which is a common word and can be well-received.

So, the word ""FROSTED"" fits the clue and is 7 letters long.

"Foreign currency racket completely disheartened auditor","dinar","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@a7cee41","<think>
The clue ""Foreign currency racket completely disheartened auditor"" suggests a word that is 5 letters long, and it is related to an auditor being disheartened by a foreign currency issue. The key here is ""racket,"" which can be a slang term for a fraudulent scheme or activity. ""Completely disheartened"" implies that the auditor was deeply affected by this issue. The word ""foreign currency"" could be related to the term ""yen,"" which is a foreign currency used in Japan. The word ""yen"" can also be an anagram of ""ney,"" which could fit the 5-letter requirement and the context of being disheartened.

The clue ""The fellow apprehending one felon"" suggests a person who is catching or arresting a criminal. The key words here are ""apprehending"" and ""felon."" ""Apprehending"" means to catch or arrest, and ""felon"" is a criminal. The phrase ""one felon"" implies that the person is dealing with a single criminal.

Given that the answer must be a 5-letter word, we need to think of a word that fits the context of catching or arresting a criminal. The word ""COP"" comes to mind, as it is a common abbreviation for a police officer, who is responsible for apprehending felons.

Let's verify if ""COP"" fits the clue:
- ""COP"" is a 5-letter word.

"Dames popular with sailors?","broads","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@a7cee41","<think>
The clue ""Dames popular with sailors"" suggests a word that is associated with sailors and women. The word ""dames"" is a key part of the clue, and it's likely that the answer is a word that is both a synonym for ""dames"" and something that sailors might be interested in. 

Given the 6-letter requirement, let's consider words that fit this description:
- ""Dames"" could be replaced with ""ladies"" or ""women.""
- Common items or activities that sailors might be interested in could include ""sails,"" ""seas,"" ""boats,"" ""waves,"" ""harbors,"" or ""cups"" (as in drinking).

The word ""sails"" is a strong candidate because it is a 6-letter word, and it is something that is directly related to sailing. It could be a play on ""sails"" being a synonym for ""dames"" in a nautical context.

Let's test ""sails"" against the clue:
- ""Sails"" is a 6-letter word.
- ""Sails"" can be a synonym for ""dames"" in a nautical context.
- ""Sails"" is something that sailors would be interested in.

Therefore, ""sails"" fits the clue perfectly.
