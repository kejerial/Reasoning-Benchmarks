"Achy shaking stopped by iodine, salt and kaolin","chinaclay","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@e5c36e8","<think>
The clue mentions ""Achy shaking"" which could refer to a physical sensation like tremors or shivers. ""Stopped by iodine, salt and kaolin"" suggests that these substances are used to treat or stop the condition. Iodine is often used in antiseptics, salt can be used in various medical treatments, and kaolin is a clay used in medicine for its soothing properties.

Given that the answer is a single word with exactly 9 letters, we need to think of a medical term that fits the description. ""Shivers"" can be associated with chills, and a common medical term for this is ""SHIVERING"". However, we need to check if there's a more fitting term that fits the clue perfectly.

Considering the substances mentioned, ""KAOLIN"" is a key part of the clue, and it's a 6-letter word. We need to think of a 9-letter word that could be derived from or associated with ""KAOLIN"" and the medical context.

A possible solution is ""KAOLINIZE"", which means to treat with kaolin. This fits the clue as it involves the use of kaolin to stop a condition like shivers or achy shaking.

Thus, the answer is ""KAOLINIZE"".

<think>
The clue describes something as ""achingly cold, like a winter's night."" This suggests a word that evokes the feeling of extreme cold and the chill of winter. 

Let's break it down:

"Paid the bail for a sound woman","freda","Downloaded from od2961/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO@e5c36e8","<think>
The clue ""Paid the bail for a sound woman"" suggests a wordplay involving ""sound"" and ""woman"". ""Sound"" can be a synonym for ""good"" or ""well"", and ""woman"" can be an anagram of ""woman"". The phrase ""paid the bail"" suggests a legal term, and ""sound"" could be a clue to a word that means ""good"" or ""well"". The word we are looking for is a 5-letter word.

Let's consider the possible words:
- ""Good"" could be an anagram of ""woman"", but it's not 5 letters.
- ""Well"" could be an anagram of ""woman"", and it's 5 letters.

So, the word we are looking for is likely ""well"".

One word that comes to mind is ""whores,"" which is a term that has been historically associated with sailors and their interactions with women. However, this word is not suitable for a crossword puzzle due to its negative connotation and explicit nature.
