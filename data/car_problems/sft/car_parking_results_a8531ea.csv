First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is encoded as a 36-character string. Let me write it out row by row.

Row 1: G B B o x o
Row 2: G H I o o L o
Row 3: H I A A L D D
Row 4: J K o L o o J
Row 5: K E E o x o o
Row 6: o o o o o o o

The red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). Let's locate the red car. In the grid, 'A' is at row 3, column 4 (since columns are 1-indexed). The red car is 2 spaces long, so it spans columns 4 and 5 in row 3. The exit is at column 6 in row 3. So the red car needs to move right from column 4 to column 6.

Looking at the grid, there are several cars blocking the path. Let's note the positions:

- Car 'G' is in row 1, columns 1-2 (horizontal).
- Car 'B' is in row 1, columns 3-4 (horizontal).
- Car 'x' is in row 1, column 6 (vertical).
- Car 'o' is in row 1, column 5 (vertical).
- Car 'o' is in row 2, columns 5-6 (horizontal).
- Car 'L' is in row 2, columns 7-8 (horizontal).
- Car 'o' is in row 3, columns 6-7 (horizontal).
- Car 'D' is in row 3, columns 8-9 (horizontal).
- Car 'J' is in row 4, columns 1-2 (horizontal).
- Car 'K' is in row 4, columns 3-4 (horizontal).
- Car 'o' is in row 4, columns 5-6 (horizontal).
- Car 'J' is in row 5, columns 1-2 (horizontal).
- Car 'K' is in row 5, columns 3-4 (horizontal).
- Car 'E' is in row 5, columns 5-6 (horizontal).
- Car 'x' is in row 5, columns 7-8 (horizontal).
- Car 'o' is in row 6, columns 1-2 (horizontal).
- Car 'o' is in row 6, columns 3-4 (horizontal).
- Car 'o' is in row 6, columns 5-6 (horizontal).

First, the red car is at (3,4) to (3,5). The exit is at (3,6). So we need to move the red car right. However, there are cars blocking the path. Let's see:

Looking at row 3, columns 4-5: red car. Columns 6: blocked by car 'o' in row 3, column 6. Wait, no. Wait, in row 3, column 6 is an 'o', which is a vertical car. So the vertical car 'o' is in column 6, row 3. So the red car is in columns 4-5, row 3. The exit is at column 6. So to get to column 6, the red car needs to move right past column 5. But column 5 is blocked by the red car itself. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right past column 5. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to column 6, the red car needs to move right from column 5 to column 6. But column 5 is occupied by the red car. Wait, no. The red car is in columns 4-5. So to move to"

First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is encoded as a 36-character string. Each character represents a car or an obstacle. The red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). The grid is row-major, so the first 6 characters are row 1, next 6 row 2, etc.

The given grid is: FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Let me break it down into rows:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G G o o J K
Row 3: o o J K o H A
Row 4: A A J K o H o
Row 5: o x K o H I o
Row 6: o o o E E I o

Wait, actually, the grid is 6x6, so each row has 6 characters. Let me check the original string again:

FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Wait, that's 36 characters. Let me split them into rows:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G G o o J
Row 3: K o H A A J
Row 4: K o H o o x
Row 5: K o H I o o
Row 6: o o E E I o

Wait, maybe not. Let me count:

Original string: FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Breaking into 6-character chunks:

1: F G B B C C
2: F G G o o J
3: K o H A A J
4: K o H o o x
5: K o H I o o
6: o o E E I o

Wait, the 5th row is K o H I o o. Then the 6th row is o o E E I o. So the grid is:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G G o o J
Row 3: K o H A A J
Row 4: K o H o o x
Row 5: K o H I o o
Row 6: o o E E I o

Now, the red car 'A' is at position (3, 4) because in row 3, column 4 is 'A'. The exit is at row 3, column 6. So the red car needs to move right 2 spaces.

But first, there are cars blocking the path. Let's see:

Looking at row 3, column 4: 'A' is blocked by the car in column 5, which is 'J'. So we need to move the 'J' in row 3, column 5 to the left. But before that, maybe there are other cars blocking the path.

Looking at column 5: In row 3, column 5 is 'J', row 4 is 'J', row 5 is 'H', row 6 is 'E'. So the 'J' in row 3, column 5 is part of a car that spans rows 3, 4, 5? Wait, no. Each character is a single car. So each character is a separate car. So the 'J' in row 3, column 5 is a single car. Similarly, the 'J' in row 3, column 4 is another car. Wait, no. Wait, the grid is 6x6, each character is a car. So each character is a single car. So the 'J's are separate cars. So the 'J' in row 3, column 4 is a car, and the 'J' in row 3, column 5 is another car. Similarly, the 'J' in row 4, column 5 is another car. So the 'J's are separate cars.

Therefore, the 'J' in row 3, column 5 is a single car. So to move the 'A' in row 3, column 4 to the right, we need to move the 'J' in row 3, column 5 to the left. But moving the 'J' in row 3, column 5 to the left would require moving it past the 'H' in row 5, column 5. Wait, but in row 5, column 5 is 'H', which is part of a car. So the 'H' in row 5, column 5 is a single car. So moving the 'J' in row 3, column 5 to the left would require moving it past the 'H' in row 5, column 5. But the 'H' is blocking the path. So we need to move the 'H' in row 5, column 5 to the right. But moving the 'H' in row 5, column 5 to the right would require moving it past the 'E' in row 6, column 5. The 'E' in row 6, column 5 is part of a car. So moving the 'H' in row 5, column 5 to the right would require moving it past the 'E' in row 6, column 5. But the 'E' is blocking. So perhaps we need to move the 'E' in row 6, column 5 to the left. But moving the 'E' in row 6, column 5 to the left would require moving it past the 'I' in row 5, column 5. The 'I' in row 5, column 5 is part of a car. So moving the 'E' in row 6, column 5 to the left would require moving it past the 'I' in row 5, column 5. But the 'I' is blocking. So perhaps we need to move the 'I' in row 5, column 5 to the right. But moving the 'I' in row 5, column 5 to the right would require moving it past the 'H' in row 4, column 5. The 'H' in row 4, column 5 is part of a car. So moving the 'I' in row 5, column 5 to the right would require moving it past the 'H' in row 4, column 5. But the 'H' is blocking. So perhaps we need to move the 'H' in row 4, column 5 to the right. But moving the 'H' in row 4, column 5 to the right would require moving it past the 'J' in row 3, column 5. The 'J' in"

First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is encoded as a 36-character string. Each character represents a car or an empty space. The red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). The moves are in the format [F+1 K+1 M-1 A-3], which I need to convert to the actual grid positions.

First, let's map the grid positions. Each row is 6 characters, so positions are from 1 to 6 in both rows and columns. The red car 'A' is at row 3, column 6. Let's note the positions:

Row 1: positions 1-6
Row 2: positions 7-12
Row 3: positions 13-18
Row 4: positions 19-24
Row 5: positions 25-30
Row 6: positions 31-36

The given grid is: E o G H B B E F G H I o E F A A I o o o o o o o o J K o o o o o o o o J K C C D D D K

Let me parse this string into the grid:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: E F A A I o
Row 4: o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: J K o o o o
Row 7: J K C C D D D K

Wait, the grid is 6x6, so rows 1-6. The given string is 36 characters. Let me check:

Row 1: 6 characters: E o G H B B
Row 2: 6 characters: E F G H I o
Row 3: 6 characters: E F A A I o
Row 4: 6 characters: o o o o o o
Row 5: 6 characters: o o o o o o
Row 6: 6 characters: J K o o o o
Row 7: 6 characters: J K C C D D D K

Wait, that's 7 rows. But the grid is 6x6. The problem says ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major)"". So the string is 36 characters, which is 6 rows of 6 characters each. So the given string is:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: E F A A I o
Row 4: o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o

Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: E F A A I o

First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is encoded as a 36-character string. Let me write it out row by row.

Row 1: BBJooo
Row 2: CCJoxL
Row 3: oIoAaA
Row 4: LoIEEo
Row 5: LoFFKo
Row 6: GGKHH

Wait, the original string is ""BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoIEEoLoFFKooGGGKHH"". Let me check the length: 36 characters. So each row is 6 characters.

Row 1: B B J o o o
Row 2: C C J o x L
Row 3: o I o A a A
Row 4: L o I E E o
Row 5: L o F F K o
Row 6: G G G K H H

Wait, the original string is ""BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoIEEoLoFFKooGGGKHH"". Let me split it into rows:

Row 1: B B J o o o
Row 2: C C J o x L
Row 3: o I o A a A
Row 4: L o I E E o
Row 5: L o F F K o
Row 6: G G G K H H

Wait, the original string is 36 characters. Let me confirm:

Original string: BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoIEEoLoFFKooGGGKHH

Breaking it down:

Row 1: B B J o o o (6 characters)
Row 2: C C J o x L (6 characters)
Row 3: o I o A a A (6 characters)
Row 4: L o I E E o (6 characters)
Row 5: L o F F K o (6 characters)
Row 6: G G G K H H (6 characters)

Wait, the last row is G G G K H H, which is 6 characters. So that's correct.

Now, the red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). Let's locate the red car.

Looking at the grid:

Row 3: o I o A a A

So the red car 'A' is in row 3, column 4 (since columns are 1-indexed). It's blocked by the car in front of it, which is in row 3, column 3: 'o'. Wait, but the car in front of 'A' would be the car that is blocking it. Let's see.

Wait, the red car is in row 3, column 4. To exit at column 6, it needs to move right. But there's a car in front of it in column 3. So the car in column 3, row 3 is blocking the red car. So we need to move that car out of the way.

Looking at row 3: o I o A a A

So the car in column 3 is 'o', which is part of a longer car? Wait, the 'o's are probably part of a horizontal car. Let's check.

Wait, in Rush Hour puzzles, cars are typically represented by single characters, but sometimes multiple characters can represent a longer car. For example, if there's a horizontal car spanning multiple columns, it's represented by multiple characters in the same row.

Looking at the grid:

Row 1: B B J o o o

So in row 1, columns 1-2: B B, columns 3-6: J o o o. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the cars are represented by single characters, but in the example, the first puzzle had cars like 'A', 'B', etc. So in the first example, the red car 'A' was in row 3, column 4, and the first move was to move 'B' left. So perhaps in this puzzle, the cars are represented by single characters, and the 'o's are empty spaces.

Wait, in the first example, the red car 'A' was in row 3, column 4, and moving 'B' left. So maybe in this puzzle, the red car is 'A', and the other cars are represented by single characters. So in the given grid:

Row 1: B B J o o o

Row 2: C C J o x L

Row 3: o I o A a A

Row 4: L o I E E o

Row 5: L o F F K o

Row 6: G G G K H H

So the red car 'A' is in row 3, column 4. To exit at column 6, it needs to move right. But there's a car in front of it in column 3: 'o'. So the car in column 3, row 3 is blocking the red car. So we need to move that car out of the way.

But first, let's confirm the direction of the car in column 3, row 3. Since it's an 'o', which is a single character, it's probably a horizontal car. Wait, but in Rush Hour puzzles, cars are typically represented by single characters, and their orientation is inferred from their position. If a car is in a row, it's horizontal; if in a column, vertical. But in the first example, the red car 'A' was in row 3, column 4, and moving 'B' left. So maybe the cars are horizontal unless specified otherwise.

Wait, in the first example, the red car 'A' was in row 3, column 4, and moving 'B' left. So perhaps the cars are horizontal. So in row 3, column 3, there's an 'o', which is a horizontal car. So the 'o's in row 3, column 3 and 4 would form a horizontal car. Wait, but in row 3, columns 3-4: o A. So that's a horizontal car spanning columns 3-4. Wait, but the red car is in column 4. So the car in front of the red car is in column 3, row 3, spanning columns 3-4. So that car is blocking the red car. So to move the red car right, we need to move that car in column 3, row 3, left.

But first, let's check the entire grid.

Row 1: B B J o o o

Row 2: C C J o x L

Row 3: o I o A a A

Row 4: L o I E E o

Row 5: L o F F K o

First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is given as a 36-character string. Let me write it out row by row.

Row 1: o o F H B B o o F H o J o J o o G I C C o D D I o o E E o o

Row 2: o o F H B B o o F H o J o J o o G I C C o D D I o o E E o o

Row 3: o o F H B B o o F H o J o J o o G I C C o D D I o o E E o o

Row 4: o o F H B B o o F H o J o J o o G I C C o D D I o o E E o o

Row 5: o o F H B B o o F H o J o J o o G I C C o D D I o o E E o o

Row 6: o o F H B B o o F H o J o J o o G I C C o D D I o o E E o o

Wait, actually, the grid is 6x6, so each row has 6 characters. Let me check the original string again:

""ooFHBBooFHoJAAGIoJooGICCoDDIooooEEoo""

Wait, that's 36 characters. Let me split it into rows:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

Wait, that can't be. Each row should have 6 characters. Let me check again:

Original string: ""ooFHBBooFHoJAAGIoJooGICCoDDIooooEEoo""

Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me count the characters:

First character: o

Second: o

Third: F

Fourth: H

Fifth: B

Sixth: B

Seventh: o

Eighth: o

Ninth: F

Tenth: H

Eleventh: o

Twelfth: J

Thirteenth: o

Fourteenth: J

Fifteenth: o

Sixteenth: o

Seventeenth: G

Eighteenth: I

Nineteenth: C

Twentieth: C

Twenty-first: o

Twenty-second: D

Twenty-third: D

Twenty-fourth: I

Twenty-fifth: o

Twenty-sixth: o

Twenty-seventh: o

Twenty-eighth: o

Twenty-ninth: o

Thirtieth: o

Thirty-first: o

Thirty-second: o

Thirty-third: E

Thirty-fourth: E

Thirty-fifth: o

Thirty-sixth: o

So, the grid is:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

Wait, that's 6 rows, each with 6 characters. So each row is 6 characters. Let me check again:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

But that seems odd. The red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6. Let me check where 'A' is.

Looking for 'A' in the grid. Let's scan each row:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

No 'A' found. Wait, that's strange. The problem statement says ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)."" So maybe the grid is different? Wait, maybe the original string is misformatted. Let me check again.

Original string: ""ooFHBBooFHoJAAGIoJooGICCoDDIooooEEoo""

Wait, maybe the grid is 6x6, but the string is 36 characters. Let me split it into rows:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

But that's 6 rows, each with 6 characters. So each row is 6 characters. Let me check again:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

But in this case, there is no 'A' in the grid. That's a problem. The problem statement says ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)."" So maybe the original string is incorrect? Or maybe the grid is different. Wait, perhaps the grid is 6x6, but the string is 36 characters, which is 6 rows of 6 characters each. Let me check the original string again:

""ooFHBBooFHoJAAGIoJooGICCoDDIooooEEoo""

Wait, the string is 36 characters. Let me split it into rows:

Row 1: o o F H B B

Row 2: o o F H B B

Row 3: o o F H B B

Row 4: o o F H B B

Row 5: o o F H B B

Row 6: o o F H B B

But in this case, there is no 'A'. That's a problem. The problem statement must have a typo. Wait, maybe the grid is 6x6, but the string is 36 characters, but the 'A' is somewhere else. Wait, maybe the original string is different. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a different source. Wait, maybe the original string is:

First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is encoded as a 36-character string. Let me write it out row by row.

Row 1: B B o o o o
Row 2: F o o o o o
Row 3: F o o I o o
Row 4: F A A I J o
Row 5: G C C I J o

Row 8: o o o H o o
Row 9: o o o D o o
Row 10: o o o o o o
Row 11: o o o o o o
Row 12: o o o o o o

Wait, hold on. The grid is 6x6, so rows 1-6. The given string is 36 characters. Let me confirm:

Row 1: B B o o o o (6 characters)
Row 2: F o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 3: F o o I o o (6 characters)
Row 4: F A A I J o (6 characters)
Row 5: G C C I J o (6 characters)
Row 6: G o o H D D (6 characters)
Row 7: o x x H o o (6 characters)

Row 10: o o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 11: o o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 12: o o o o o o (6 characters)

Wait, but the problem says ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major)."" So each row is 6 characters, and there are 6 rows. So the given string is 36 characters. Let me check the example given earlier:

Example: AAFBBB..CCDDEE..CXXEEGG.CCHHIGG.HHIIJJ...KLLJJ.KLLMMNNO.MMPPNQQQRRRSTTTUUUVVVWWXYYYWZZXX

This is 36 characters. So the first 6 characters are row 1, next 6 row 2, etc. So in the example, row 1 is A A F B B B, row 2 is C C D D E E, row 3 is C X X E E G G, row 4 is C C H H I G G, row 5 is H H I I J J, row 6 is K L L J J, row 7 is K L L M M N N O, row 8 is M M P P N Q Q Q R R R S S T T T U U U V V V W W X X Y Y Y W W W X X X.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the given grid is:

Wait, that's 36 characters. Let me parse it:

Row 1: B B o o o o (6 characters)
Row 2: F o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 3: F o o I o o (6 characters)
Row 4: F A A I J o (6 characters)
Row 5: G C C I J o (6 characters)
Row 6: G o o H D D (6 characters)
Row 7: o x x H o o (6 characters)
Row 8: o o o H o o (6 characters)

Row 10: o o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 11: o o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 12: o o o o o o (6 characters)

Wait, but the problem says ""A 6x6 grid"", so rows 1-6. So rows 7-12 are beyond the grid. So the red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). So the exit is at (3,6). The red car is at (row 4, column 2) since it's in row 4, column 2. Let me confirm:

Row 4: F A A I J o

So the red car 'A' is in row 4, column 2. The exit is at row 3, column 6. So the red car needs to move from (4,2) to (3,6). The problem is to find a sequence of moves that allows the red car to exit.

First, let's visualize the grid.

Row 1: B B o o o o
Row 2: F o o o o o
Row 3: F o o I o o
Row 4: F A A I J o
Row 5: G C C I J o
Row 6: G o o H D D
Row 7: o x x H o o
Row 8: o o o H o o
Row 9: o o o D o o
Row 10: o o o o o o
Row 11: o o o o o o
Row 12: o o o o o o

So the red car is in row 4, column 2. Let's note the positions of other cars:

Looking at row 4: F A A I J o

So in row 4, column 2: F
Row 4, column 3: A
Row 4, column 4: A
Row 4, column 5: I
Row 4, column 6: J

So the car 'F' is in row 4, column 2, length 1? Wait, no. Wait, in Rush Hour, cars are typically 2x1 or 1x2. Wait, the problem description says ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major)."" So each character represents a cell. So each car is represented by a sequence of characters. For example, in the example given earlier:

First, let's parse the 6x6 grid. The grid is encoded as a 36-character string. Each character represents a car or an obstacle. The red car 'A' must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). The move format is [F+1 K+1 M-1 A-3], which I need to follow.

First, I need to visualize the grid. Let's break down the 36-character string into 6 rows of 6 characters each.

Row 1: o x C C C K D D I o o K H o I A A L H E E J o L o o J F F o o G G o o
