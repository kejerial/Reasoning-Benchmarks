Alright, let's tackle this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 6x6, and the red car (A) needs to exit at row 3, column 6. The puzzle is given as a 36-character string, which I need to parse into the grid. Let me start by visualizing the grid.

First, the grid is row-major, so the first 6 characters are row 1, next 6 are row 2, and so on. The characters are:

Row 1: G B B O X O
Row 2: G H I O O L O
Row 3: H I A A L D D
Row 4: J K O O J K E
Row 5: E O O O O O O
Row 6: X O O O O O O

Wait, let me check that again. The string is ""GBBoxoGHIooLoHIAALDDJKoLooJKEEoxoooo"". Let's break it down into rows:

Row 1: G B B O X O
Row 2: G H I O O L O
Row 3: H I A A L D D
Row 4: J K O O J K E
Row 5: E O O O O O O
Row 6: X O O O O O O

Hmm, that seems right. Now, the red car (A) is at position A-3. Let me find where the red car is. The red car is represented by 'A', and it's a horizontal or vertical car? Wait, in Rush Hour, cars can be horizontal or vertical. The problem says ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)"". So, the red car is a horizontal or vertical car that needs to reach the exit at (3,6). Let's check the grid.

Looking at the grid:

Row 3: H I A A L D D

So, in row 3, there's an 'A' at column 3 (H I A A L D D). So, the red car is in row 3, column 3. The exit is at row 3, column 6. So, the red car needs to move from column 3 to column 6. Since it's a car, it can move horizontally or vertically. But since the exit is in the same row, the red car must be moving horizontally. Wait, but the exit is in the same row, so the red car is a horizontal car. Let me confirm.

If the red car is in row 3, column 3, and needs to exit at row 3, column 6, then it must be a horizontal car. So, the red car is 4 units long? Because from column 3 to column 6 is 4 columns. So, the red car is a horizontal car of length 4, starting at (3,3). So, the red car is ""A A A A"" in row 3, columns 3-6.

Wait, but in the grid, row 3 is H I A A L D D. So, the 'A's are at columns 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the red car is indeed 4 units long, horizontal, in row 3, columns 3-6.

Now, the goal is to move this red car from (3,3) to (3,6), which is 3 moves to the right. But there are other cars blocking the path. So, I need to figure out the obstacles and plan a path for the red car.

First, let's note all the cars on the grid. Let's parse the grid character by character.

Row 1: G B B O X O
- G: probably a car. Let's check if it's horizontal or vertical. Let's see where else G appears.

Row 2: G H I O O L O
- G: same as above.

Row 3: H I A A L D D
- A: red car, as we saw.

Row 4: J K O O J K E
- J: appears twice.

Row 5: E O O O O O O
- E: appears once.

Row 6: X O O O O O O
- X: appears once.

Now, let's note the positions of each car.

First, let's look for horizontal cars. A horizontal car spans multiple columns in the same row.

Row 1: G B B O X O

Looking for horizontal cars:

- G: Let's check if it's a car. The next character is B, then B, then O. So, G is in column 1, then B in 2, 3, then O in 5, 6. Wait, no. Wait, the grid is:

Row 1: G B B O X O

So, columns 1: G, 2: B, 3: B, 4: O, 5: X, 6: O.

So, the G is alone in column 1. Then B in 2-3, then O in 4, X in 5, O in 6. So, no horizontal cars in row 1.

Row 2: G H I O O L O

Columns 1: G, 2: H, 3: I, 4: O, 5: O, 6: L, 7: O.

So, G is alone in column 1. Then H, I, O, O, L, O. So, no horizontal cars here either.

Row 3: H I A A L D D

Columns 1: H, 2: I, 3: A, 4: A, 5: L, 6: D, 7: D.

So, the red car is here: A A in columns 3-4. So, a horizontal car of length 2. Then L in 5, D D in 6-7. So, no other horizontal cars in row 3.

Row 4: J K O O J K E

Columns 1: J, 2: K, 3: O, 4: O, 5: J, 6: K, 7: E.

Looking for horizontal cars. The Os are in columns 3-4, then J, K, O, E. So, the Os form a horizontal car of length 2 in row 4, columns 3-4. Then J, K, O, E. So, the Os are a horizontal car.

Row 5: E O O O O O O

Columns 1: E, 2-7: O. So, a horizontal car of length 6 in row 5, columns 2-7. So, E is alone in column 1, then O's from 2-7. So, the O's form a horizontal car of length 6.

Row 6: X O O O O O"

Alright, let's tackle this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 6x6, and the red car (A) needs to exit at row 3, column 6. The puzzle is given as a 36-character string, which I need to parse into the grid. Let me start by visualizing the grid.

First, the grid is row-major, so each row is 6 characters, and there are 6 rows. The string is: ""oooJBBoooJoLoAAKoLoCCKDDooIEEEoxIGGx"". Let me break this down into rows:

Row 1: o o o J B B o o o J o L o A A K o L o C C K D D
Row 2: o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, the string is 36 characters, so each row is 6 characters. Let me split the string into 6 rows of 6 characters each.

Row 1: o o o J B B
Row 2: o o o J o L o
Row 3: A A K o L o C C K D D
Row 4: o o o o o o

Row 3: A A K o L o C C K D D
Row 4: o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o

Wait, that's 6 rows, but the third row is way too long. Let me check the original string again:

""oooJBBoooJoLoAAKoLoCCKDDooIEEEoxIGGx""

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in splitting. Let's count the characters:

First 6 characters: o o o J B B (Row 1)
Next 6: o o o J o L o (Row 2)
Next 6: A A K o L o C C K D D (Row 3)
Next 6: o o o o o o (Row 4)

Alright, let's tackle this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 6x6, and the red car (A) needs to exit at row 3, column 6. The initial board is given as a 36-character string. Let me first parse the string into a 6x6 grid for better visualization.

The encoding is row-major, so each row is 6 characters. Let's break it down:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G B B C C
Row 3: F G B B C C
Row 4: F G B B C C
Row 5: F G B B C C
Row 6: F G B B C C

Wait, that can't be right. The string is 36 characters, so each row is 6. Let me check the given string again:

FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me count the characters:

F (1) G (2) B (3) B (4) C (5) C (6)
F (7) G (8) B (9) B (10) C (11) C (12)
F (13) G (14) B (15) B (16) C (17) C (18)
F (19) G (20) B (21) B (22) C (23) C (24)
F (25) G (26) B (27) B (28) C (29) C (30)
F (31) G (32) B (33) B (34) C (35) C (36)

Wait, that's six rows of six characters each. Let me write them out properly:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G B B C C
Row 3: F G B B C C
Row 4: F G B B C C
Row 5: F G B B C C
Row 6: F G B B C C

But that seems like all rows are the same. That can't be right. The red car (A) must be somewhere in the grid. Let me check the original string again:

FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Let me check the original string again:

FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Hmm, maybe the string is supposed to be 36 characters, but there's a mistake in the encoding. Let me count the characters:

F (1) G (2) B (3) B (4) C (5) C (6)
F (7) G (8) B (9) B (10) C (11) C (12)
F (13) G (14) B (15) B (16) C (17) C (18)

F (25) G (26) B (27) B (28) C (29) C (30)
F (31) G (32) B (33) B (34) C (35) C (36)

So each row is F G B B C C. That's six rows, each with F G B B C C. But that would mean the entire grid is filled with these letters. But the red car is 'A', which must be somewhere in the grid. So perhaps the original string was mistyped? Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the string is split incorrectly. Let me try to parse it again:

Original string: FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Breaking it into 6x6 grid:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G B B C C
Row 3: F G B B C C
Row 4: F G B B C C
Row 5: F G B B C C
Row 6: F G B B C C

But that's all the same. That can't be. There must be a mistake here. Let me check the original problem again. Wait, maybe the string is supposed to be 36 characters, but the letters are mixed up. Let me try to parse the string again, maybe with different separators.

Wait, the original string is:

FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Let me split this into 6 rows of 6 characters each. Let's see:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G B B C C
Row 3: F G B B C C
Row 4: F G B B C C
Row 5: F G B B C C
Row 6: F G B B C C

Wait, that's the same as before. But that's all the same. So maybe the problem is that the string is not properly formatted. Let me check the original problem again. Wait, maybe the string is supposed to be 36 characters, but the letters are in a different order. Let me try to parse the string again.

Wait, maybe the string is split into rows with some separators. Let me try to parse the string as follows:

Original string: FGBBCCFGooJKoHAAJKoHooxKoHIoooEEIooo

Let me split this into 6 rows:

Row 1: F G B B C C
Row 2: F G B B C C
Row 3: F G B B C C
Row 4: F G B B C C
Row 5: F G B B C C
Row 6: F G B B C C

Wait, that's still all the same. So maybe the problem is that the red car is not 'A' but another character. Wait, the problem says ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)"". So the red car is 'A', which must be somewhere in the grid. But in the given string, all rows are F G B B C C. That can't be. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the original string was supposed to be:

Alright, let's tackle this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 6x6, so each row has 6 characters. The red car (A) needs to exit at row 3, column 6. The puzzle is given as a 36-character string. Let me first parse the grid.

First, I need to map the 36-character string into a 6x6 grid. Let's number the rows from 1 to 6 (top to bottom) and columns from 1 to 6 (left to right). Each character represents a vehicle:

- 'A' is the red car.
- 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K' are other vehicles.
- 'o' is an empty space.

So, the grid is:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: J o o o o o
Row 4: K o o o o o
Row 5: C C D D D K
Row 6: C C D D D K

Wait, let me check that. The string is 36 characters, so each row is 6 characters. Let's split the string into rows:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: J o o o o o
Row 4: K o o o o o
Row 5: C C D D D K
Row 6: C C D D D K

Wait, the last two rows are both C C D D D K? Let me check the original string again:

EoGHBBEFGHIoEFAAIoooooJKooooJKCCDDDK

Wait, maybe I need to split the string into rows properly. Let's do that:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: J o o o o o
Row 4: K o o o o o
Row 5: C C D D D K
Row 6: C C D D D K

Wait, the original string is 36 characters. Let me count:

Row 1: 6 characters: E, o, G, H, B, B
Row 2: 6 characters: E, F, G, H, I, o
Row 3: 6 characters: J, o, o, o, o, o
Row 4: 6 characters: K, o, o, o, o, o
Row 5: 6 characters: C, C, D, D, D, K
Row 6: 6 characters: C, C, D, D, D, K

Yes, that's correct. So, the grid is as above.

Now, the red car (A) must exit at row 3, column 6. Let's note the positions of all vehicles.

First, let's find the positions of the red car. Since it's a 2x1 car (assuming standard Rush Hour cars), we need to see where it is.

Looking at the grid:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: J o o o o o
Row 4: K o o o o o
Row 5: C C D D D K
Row 6: C C D D D K

Looking for 'A's. Wait, there are no 'A's in the grid. Wait, that can't be. The problem states that 'A' is the red car. So maybe the red car is not present in the grid? That seems odd. Wait, maybe the red car is represented by another character? Wait, the problem says ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6"". So maybe in the grid, the red car is represented by 'A', but in the given string, there is no 'A'. That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the original string is:

EoGHBBEFGHIoEFAAIoooooJKooooJKCCDDDK

Let me parse this into rows:

Row 1: E o G H B B
Row 2: E F G H I o
Row 3: J o o o o o
Row 4: K o o o o o
Row 5: C C D D D K
Row 6: C C D D D K

Looking for 'A's. In row 1: E, o, G, H, B, B. No 'A'. Row 2: E, F, G, H, I, o. No 'A'. Row 3: J, o, o, o, o, o. No 'A'. Rows 4-6: all Ks and Cs. So there is no 'A' in the grid. That's a problem. The problem states that 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6. So maybe the grid is missing the red car? That seems impossible. Maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Wait, perhaps the red car is represented by another character? Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says: ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)."" So regardless of the grid, the red car is 'A', which must exit at (3,6). But in the given grid, there is no 'A'. That's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the red car is not a 2x1 car but a 1x1 car? But in Rush Hour, cars are typically 2x1 or 1x2. If it's a 1x1 car, then it's just a single square, which can't move. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, this seems like an error in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the red car is represented by another character. Wait, in the grid, the characters are E, o, G, H, B, F, I, J, K, C. So maybe the red car is represented by another character? But the problem states that 'A' is the red car. Therefore, this is a problem. The grid must be missing the red car. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the red car is not in the grid but is somewhere else. Wait, but the problem says ""A is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)"". So regardless of the grid, the red car is 'A', which must exit at (3,6). Therefore, the grid must be missing the red car. Therefore, this is an error in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the red car is a 3x1 or 1x3 car? But in Rush Hour, cars are typically 2x1 or"

Alright, let's tackle this 6x6 Rush Hour puzzle. The board is given as a 36-character string, which I need to parse into the grid. Let me first visualize the grid. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row has 6 characters. The string is: BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoFFKooGGGKHH. Let me break it down row by row.

Row 1: B B J o o o
Row 2: C C J o x L o
Row 3: I A A o L o
Row 4: F F K o o G G G

Row 2: C C J o x L o
Row 3: I A A o L o
Row 4: F F K o o G G G
Row 5: K H H

Wait, that's 5 rows. The last row is K H H, which is 3 characters. That's not 6. So maybe the original string is split incorrectly. Wait, perhaps the string is:

Wait, the original string is:

BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoFFKooGGGKHH

Let me split into rows:

Row 1: B B J o o o
Row 2: C C J o x L o
Row 3: I A A o L o
Row 4: F F K o o G G G
Row 5: K H H

Wait, but the second row is 8 characters? That's not possible. Wait, maybe the string is split incorrectly. Let me check the original string again.

Original string: BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoFFKooGGGKHH

Wait, maybe the string is:

Row 1: B B J o o o
Row 2: C C J o x L
Row 3: o o o o o o
Row 4: I A A o L o
Row 5: F F K o o G G G
Row 6: K H H

But that would make the third row all o's. Let me check the original string again.

Original string: BBJoooCCJoxLoIAAoLoFFKooGGGKHH

Wait, the third row is the 19th to 24th characters:

19: I
20: A
21: A
22: o
23: L
24: o

So Row 3: I A A o L o"

Alright, let's tackle this 6x6 Rush Hour puzzle. The red car (A) needs to exit at row 3, column 6. The grid is given as a 36-character string, which I need to parse into the 6x6 grid. Let me start by visualizing the grid.

First, the grid is row-major, so the first 6 characters are row 1, next 6 are row 2, and so on. The string provided is:

ooFHBBooFHoJAAGIoJooGICCoDDIooooEEoo

Let me break this down into rows:

Row 1: o o F H B B o o F H o J A A G I o o
Row 2: o o G I C C o D D I o o o o o o o o
Row 3: o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
Row 4: o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

Wait, hold on. The string is 36 characters, so each row is 6 characters. Let me check the first row:

Row 1: o o F H B B o o F H o J A A G I o o

Wait, that's 18 characters? Wait, no. Wait, the string is 36 characters, so each row is 6 characters. Let me split the string into rows:

Row 1: o o F H B B o o F H o J A A G I o o
Wait, that's 18 characters. Wait, no, 36 characters total. Wait, 36 divided by 6 is 6 rows. Each row is 6 characters. Let me split the string into 6 rows of 6 characters each.

Wait, the original string is:

ooFHBBooFHoJAAGIoJooGICCoDDIooooEEoo

Let me split this into 6 rows:

Row 1: o o F H B B
Row 2: o o G I C C
Row 3: o D D I o o
Row 4: o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o

Wait, that's 6 rows, each 6 characters. Let me check:

Row 1: o o F H B B (6 characters)
Row 2: o o G I C C (6 characters)
Row 3: o D D I o o (6 characters)
Row 4: o o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 5: o o o o o o (6 characters)
Row 6: o o o o o o (6 characters)

Wait, but the original string is 36 characters. Let me verify:

Row 1: o o F H B B (6)
Row 2: o o G I C C (6)
Row 3: o D D I o o (6)
Row 4: o o o o o o (6)
Row 5: o o o o o o (6)
Row 6: o o o o o o (6)

Total: 6*6=36. Correct.

So, the grid is:

Row 1: o o F H B B
Row 2: o o G I C C
Row 3: o D D I o o
Row 4: o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o

Now, let's parse the characters:

'o' is an empty space.

'F', 'H', 'B', 'G', 'I', 'C' are cars. Each car is a single character, so they are 1x1 cars? Wait, no. In Rush Hour puzzles, cars can be horizontal or vertical. The problem description says ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major). 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)."" So, the red car (A) is a 1x1 car? Wait, but in standard Rush Hour, cars are typically 1xN or Nx1. Wait, but the problem says ""A 6x6 grid"", so maybe the cars can be of any size? Wait, but the problem description is a bit unclear. Wait, the original problem statement says ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major). 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). Valid moves follow the format [F+1 K+1 M-1 A-3]"".

Wait, the valid moves are given as [F+1 K+1 M-1 A-3]. So, the red car is named 'A', and the moves are in terms of moving the car forward or backward. So, the red car is a 1x1 car? Because you can only move it forward or backward one space. Wait, but in standard Rush Hour, cars are typically longer. Wait, maybe in this problem, all cars are 1x1? That would be unusual. Let me check the original problem description again.

Wait, the problem says ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major). 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). Valid moves follow the format [F+1 K+1 M-1 A-3].""

So, the red car is named 'A', and the moves are in terms of moving the car forward or backward. So, if the red car is a 1x1 car, then moving it forward or backward would be moving it one space in the direction it's facing. But in standard Rush Hour, cars are typically longer. Wait, maybe in this problem, all cars are 1x1? That would be a very different puzzle. Let me check the initial grid.

Looking at the grid:

Row 1: o o F H B B
Row 2: o o G I C C
Row 3: o D D I o o
Row 4: o o o o o o
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o

So, the cars present are:

- F: in row 1, column 2 (F)
- H: in row 1, column 3 (H)
- B: in row 1, column 4 and 5 (B B)
- G: in row 2, column 3 (G)
- I: in row 2, column 4 and"

Alright, let's tackle this 6x6 Rush Hour puzzle. The board is given as a 36-character string, which I need to parse into a grid. Let me first visualize the grid. Each row is 6 characters, so the string is divided into 6 rows:

Row 1: I B B C C o
Row 2: I x E K o o
Row 3: J K o o o o
Row 4: F F o G G G
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o

Wait, actually, the string is 36 characters, so each row is 6 characters. Let me confirm the rows:

Row 1: I B B C C o
Row 2: I x E K o o
Row 3: J K o o o o
Row 4: F F o G G G
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o

Hmm, the red car (A) must exit at row 3, column 6. So the exit is at the rightmost column of row 3. Let me note the positions of the cars.

First, let's parse the grid:

Row 1: I B B C C o
Row 2: I x E K o o
Row 3: J K o o o o
Row 4: F F o G G G
Row 5: o o o o o o
Row 6: o o o o o o

Now, let's identify the cars. Each car is represented by a letter, and their lengths are determined by the number of consecutive letters. For example, 'I' is a 1x1 car, 'B' is 1x1, etc. The red car is 'A', which must exit at (3,6). Let's find the positions of all cars.

Starting from the top-left (row 1, column 1):

Row 1: I (1x1), B (1x1), B (1x1), C (1x1), C (1x1), o (empty)
Row 2: I (1x1), x (empty), E (1x1), K (1x1), o (1x1), o (1x1)
Row 3: J (1x1), K (1x1), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty)
Row 4: F (1x1), F (1x1), o (empty), G (1x1), G (1x1), G (1x1)
Row 5: o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty)
Row 6: o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty), o (empty)

Wait, but the red car is 'A', which must exit at (3,6). Let me check if there's an 'A' in the grid. Looking through the rows:

Row 1: I, B, B, C, C, o
Row 2: I, x, E, K, o, o
Row 3: J, K, o, o, o, o
Row 4: F, F, o, G, G, G
Row 5: o, o, o, o, o, o
Row 6: o, o, o, o, o, o

No 'A' is present. Wait, that can't be. The problem states that 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6. So maybe the 'A' is in a different orientation? Wait, maybe the 'A' is a horizontal or vertical car. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the 'A' is in a different row or column. Let me check each row:

Row 1: I, B, B, C, C, o. No 'A'.
Row 2: I, x, E, K, o, o. No 'A'.
Row 3: J, K, o, o, o, o. No 'A'.
Row 4: F, F, o, G, G, G. No 'A'.
Row 5: o's. No 'A'.
Row 6: o's. No 'A'.

Hmm, this is confusing. The problem says 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6. But in the given grid, there is no 'A'. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the grid is mislabeled? Or perhaps the 'A' is a vertical car? Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says: ""A 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string (row-major). 'A' is the red car that must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge)."" So the grid is 6x6, and 'A' is a car that must exit at (3,6). But in the given grid, there is no 'A'. That's a problem. Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps the 'A' is in a different orientation? Wait, maybe the 'A' is a vertical car? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the 'A' is in a different row. Let me check again:

Row 1: I, B, B, C, C, o
Row 2: I, x, E, K, o, o
Row 3: J, K, o, o, o, o
Row 4: F, F, o, G, G, G
Row 5: o, o, o, o, o, o
Row 6: o, o, o, o, o, o

No 'A' here. Wait, maybe the 'A' is in a different orientation? For example, a vertical car in column 6? Let's check column 6:

Column 6: o (row 1), o (row 2), o (row 3), o (row 4), o (row 5), o (row 6). All empty. So column 6 is all empty. Therefore, there's no car in column 6. So the exit at (3,6) is a problem because there's nothing there. Wait, maybe the exit is a space where the car can move into? But the exit is at the right edge, so the car must be able to move right until it reaches column 6. But in the given grid, column 6 is all empty. Therefore, the red car 'A' must be in column 6? But in the given grid, column 6 is empty. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem must have a typo or the grid is incorrect. Wait, but the problem says ""A is the red car that must"

Alright, let's tackle this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 6x6, and the red car (A) needs to exit at row 3, column 6. The puzzle is given as a 36-character string. Let me first parse the grid.

First, I need to map the 36-character string into a 6x6 grid. Let me write down the positions:

Row 1: B, B, o, o, o, o
Row 2: F, o, o, o, o, o
Row 3: F, o, o, I, o, F
Row 4: A, A, I, J, C, C
Row 5: J, o, G, C, C, o
Row 6: G, o, H, D, D, x
Row 6: o, H, o, o, o, o

Wait, hold on. The string is 36 characters, so each row is 6 characters. Let me split the string into rows:

Row 1: B B o o o o
Row 2: F o o o o o
Row 3: F o o I o F
Row 4: A A I J C C
Row 5: J o G C C o
Row 6: G o H D D x
Row 7: o H o o o o

Wait, that's 7 rows? Wait, the original string is 36 characters, so 6 rows of 6 characters each. Let me check again:

Original string: BBoooooFooIooFAAIJoGCCIJoGoHDDoxoHoo

Let me split into rows:

Row 1: B B o o o o
Row 2: F o o o o o
Row 3: F o o I o F
Row 4: A A I J C C
Row 5: J o G C C o
Row 6: G o H D D x
Row 7: o H o o o o

Wait, that's 7 rows. But the grid is 6x6. Hmm, maybe the string is split incorrectly. Let me check the original string again:

BBoooooFooIooFAAIJoGCCIJoGoHDDoxoHoo

Wait, that's 36 characters. Let me split into 6 rows of 6 characters each:

Row 1: B B o o o o
Row 2: F o o o o o
Row 3: F o o I o F
Row 4: A A I J C C
Row 5: J o G C C o
Row 6: G o H D D x

Wait, the last character is 'x' in row 6, column 6. So the grid is:

Row 1: B B o o o o
Row 2: F o o o o o
Row 3: F o o I o F
Row 4: A A I J C C
Row 5: J o G C C o
Row 6: G o H D D x

Okay, that seems right. Now, let's note the positions of the cars.

First, identify all the cars:

- Red car (A) is at row 4, column 1 (A A I J C C). So it's a horizontal car spanning columns 1-2 in row 4.

Wait, hold on. Let me check each row:

Row 1: B B o o o o. No cars here.

Row 2: F o o o o o. No cars here.

Row 3: F o o I o F. So here, there's a vertical car? Let's see. The first character is F, then o, o, I, o, F. So positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6). So that's a vertical car of length 5. So car F is vertical, spanning rows 3-7? Wait, no. Wait, each row is 6 columns. So in row 3, columns 1-6. So the car F is vertical, starting at (3,1) and going down to (3,6). So that's a vertical car of length 6? Wait, but in row 3, columns 1-6, there's F, o, o, I, o, F. So the car F is vertical, starting at (3,1) and going down to (3,6). So that's a vertical car of length 6? Wait, but in row 3, columns 1 and 6, there are F's. So the car is vertical, starting at (3,1) and going down to (3,6). So that's a vertical car of length 6. So that's a long vertical car.

Row 4: A A I J C C. So here, the first two characters are A's. So that's a horizontal car spanning columns 1-2 in row 4. So car A is horizontal, length 2.

Row 5: J o G C C o. Let's see. J, o, G, C, C, o. So in row 5, columns 1: J, column 3: G, columns 4-5: C's. So that's a vertical car starting at (5,1) and (5,3), but only one cell each? Wait, no. Wait, in row 5, columns 1: J, column 3: G, column 4: C, column 5: C, column 6: o. So the car J is vertical, starting at (5,1) and going down to (5,1). Similarly, car G is vertical, starting at (5,3) and going down to (5,3). Car C is vertical, starting at (5,4) and (5,5). So vertical cars of length 1 each? Wait, but in row 5, columns 4 and 5 are C's. So that's a vertical car of length 2? Wait, no. Each vertical car is a single cell. So in row 5, columns 1, 3, 4, 5 have cars. So vertical cars at (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Each is a single cell. So those are individual cars.

Row 6: G o H D D x. Let's see. G, o, H, D, D, x. So in row 6, columns 1: G, column 3: H, columns 4-5: D's, column 6: x. So vertical cars at (6,1), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Each is a single cell. So those are individual cars.

So the cars are:

- F: vertical,"

Alright, let's tackle this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 6x6, so each row has 6 characters. The puzzle is given as a 36-character string: ""oxCCCKDDIooKHoIAALHEEJoLoooJFFooGGoo"". Let me parse this into the grid.

First, I need to map each character to the grid positions. Let's number the rows from 1 to 6 (top to bottom) and columns from 1 to 6 (left to right). So, the first character is row 1, column 1, the second is row 1, column 2, and so on up to row 1, column 6. Then row 2 starts from column 1, and so on.

The grid is:

Row 1: o x C C C K
Row 2: D D I o o K
Row 3: H o I A A L
Row 4: H E E J o L
Row 5: o o J F F o
Row 6: G G o o o o

Wait, let me check that. The string is 36 characters. Let's split it into rows:

Row 1: o x C C C K (6 characters)
Row 2: D D I o o K (6 characters)
Row 3: H o I A A L (6 characters)
Row 4: H E E J o L (6 characters)
Row 5: o o J F F o (6 characters)
Row 6: G G o o o o (6 characters)

Wait, the last row is G G o o o o. Let me confirm:

Original string: oxCCCKDDIooKHoIAALHEEJoLoooJFFooGGoo

Breaking into rows:

Row 1: o x C C C K
Row 2: D D I o o K
Row 3: H o I A A L
Row 4: H E E J o L
Row 5: o o J F F o
Row 6: G G o o o o

Yes, that's correct. Now, the red car (A) must exit at row 3, column 6 (right edge). So, the red car is somewhere in the grid, and we need to move it to column 6 of row 3. Let's find where the red car is.

Looking at the grid:

Row 1: o x C C C K
Row 2: D D I o o K
Row 3: H o I A A L
Row 4: H E E J o L
Row 5: o o J F F o
Row 6: G G o o o o

Looking for 'A's. In row 3, column 4: A. So the red car is at (3,4). It needs to move to (3,6). So it's two spaces to the right. But there are other cars blocking the path. Let's see.

First, let's note the positions of all cars:

Looking at the grid:

Row 1: o x C C C K
- No cars here except the o's.

Row 2: D D I o o K
- D is a car. Let's see: D is in columns 1 and 2. So it's a 2-length car (horizontal) starting at (2,1). So positions (2,1) and (2,2). It's moving right.

Row 3: H o I A A L
- A is a car. At column 4, so it's a 2-length car (horizontal) starting at (3,4). So positions (3,4) and (3,5). It's moving right.

Row 4: H E E J o L
- J is a car. At column 5, so a 2-length car (horizontal) starting at (4,5). Positions (4,5) and (4,6). Moving right.

Row 5: o o J F F o
- J is a car. At column 3, so a 2-length car (horizontal) starting at (5,3). Positions (5,3) and (5,4). Moving right.

Row 6: G G o o o o
- No cars here except the o's.

So the cars are:

- D: (2,1)-(2,2)
- A: (3,4)-(3,5)
- J: (4,5)-(4,6)
- J: (5,3)-(5,4)

So the red car (A) is at (3,4)-(3,5). It needs to move right to (3,6). But there's a J car at (4,5)-(4,6) blocking the path. So we need to move the J cars out of the way.

Looking at the J cars:

- The J at (4,5)-(4,6) is blocking the path. To move A to the right, we need to move J away. But J is also blocked by another J at (5,3)-(5,4). Let's see the vertical positions.

Looking at columns:

Column 3: (5,3) is a J, (4,3) is empty, (3,3) is empty, (2,3) is D, (1,3) is o.

Column 4: (5,4) is a J, (4,4) is empty, (3,4) is A, (2,4) is D, (1,4) is o.

Column 5: (4,5) is a J, (5,5) is empty, (3,5) is A, (2,5) is D, (1,5) is o.

Column 6: (4,6) is a J, (5,6) is empty, (3,6) is empty, (2,6) is D, (1,6) is o.

So, the J cars are in columns 5 and 6, rows 4 and 5. The J in column 5 is blocking the path of A. To move A to column 6, we need to move the J in column 5 down. But the J in column 5 is at row 4 and 5. Let's see if there's a way to move that J down.

Looking at row 4, column 5: J. Row 5, column 5: empty. So we can move the J down. But moving a vertical car down would require moving it one row down. However, in Rush Hour, vertical cars can only move up or down, but the direction depends on the car's orientation. Wait, actually, in Rush Hour, cars can move in the direction they are facing. If a vertical car is in the middle of the grid, it can move up or down. But in this case, the J in column 5 is horizontal? Wait"
