The board is a 6x6 grid encoded as a 36-character string. We need to move the red car (A) to the exit at row 3, column 6.

1. First, let's identify the positions of the cars:
   - Red car (A): Not visible yet, we need to find it.
   - Blue car (B): Row 1, column 2 to 3.
   - Orange car (O): Row 1, column 4 to 6.
   - Green car (G): Row 2, column 1 to 3.
   - Yellow car (Y): Row 2, column 4 to 6.
   - Black car (X): Row 3, column 1 to 3.
   - Light blue car (L): Row 3, column 4 to 6.
   - Dark blue car (D): Row 4, column 1 to 3.
   - Light green car (J): Row 4, column 4 to 6.
   - Dark green car (K): Row 5, column 1 to 3.
   - Dark red car (R): Row 5, column 4 to 6.
   - Light red car (I): Row 6, column 1 to 3.

2. The red car (A) is currently in row 6, column 3. We need to move it to row 3, column 6.

3. To do this, we need to clear the path. Let's start by moving the cars that are blocking the path:
   - Move the dark red car (R) to row 5, column 5.
   - Move the light red car (I) to row 6, column 4.
   - Move the dark green car (K) to row 5, column 2.
   - Move the light green car (J) to row 4, column 5.
   - Move the black car (X) to row 3, column 2.
   - Move the light blue car (L) to row 3, column 5.
   - Move the dark blue car (D) to row 4, column 2.
   - Move the orange car (O) to row 1, column 5.
   - Move the blue car (B) to row 1, column 4.
   - Move the green car (G) to row 2, column 4.
   - Move the yellow car (Y) to row 2, column 2.

4. Now, the path is clear. We can move the red car (A) to the exit:
   - Move the red car (A) to row 3, column 6.

8. [D-1]: Move the dark blue car (D) one step to the left. This clears the path for the red car (A) to move to the left.
9. [O+4]: Move the orange car (O) four steps to the right. This clears the path for the red car (A) to move to the right.
10. [B+3]: Move the blue car (B) three steps down. This clears the path for the red car (A) to move down.
11. [G+1]: Move the green car (G) one step to the right. This clears the path for the red car (A) to move to the right.
12. [Y-2]: Move the yellow car (Y) two steps to the left. This clears the path for the red car (A) to move to the left.

1. The red car (A) is initially at row 2, column 4.
2. The blue cars (B) are blocking the red car's path. There are two blue cars, one at row 2, column 1 and another at row 2, column 2.
3. The green cars (G) are also blocking the path. There are two green cars, one at row 5, column 4 and another at row 5, column 5.
4. The yellow cars (Y) are at row 4, column 3 and row 4, column 4, and the orange cars (O) are at row 1, column 3 and row 1, column 4.

To solve this, we need to move the blue and green cars out of the way. Let's start by moving the blue cars.

First, move the blue car at row 2, column 1 to the right:
- [B+1]

Now, move the blue car at row 2, column 2 to the right:
- [B+1]

Next, we need to move the green cars. Start by moving the green car at row 5, column 4 to the left:
- [G-1]

Then, move the green car at row 5, column 5 to the left:
- [G-1]

Now, we can move the red car to the right:
- [A+1]

Continue moving the red car to the right:
- [A+1]
- [A+1]
- [A+1]
- [A+1]

Finally, move the red car to the exit:

However, the actual sequence of moves would be more complex and involve multiple steps to clear the path completely. The provided sequence is a conceptual representation of moving all cars that are in the way of the red car's path to the left. The actual solution would involve a series of moves that clear the path step-by-step. The exact sequence would need to be refined to ensure the red car can exit without any obstacles. 

For a complete solution, the moves would need to be carefully planned to ensure the red car can move right to the exit. The provided sequence is a starting point for the reasoning process. The actual solution would involve a more detailed and step-by-step approach to clear the path for the red car. 

Given the complexity and the need for a detailed step-by-step solution, the exact sequence of moves would be more involved and would need to be verified through a more detailed analysis. The provided sequence is a conceptual representation and not the final solution. 

The final board solution would be the result of the red car (A) being at (3,6) with all other cars cleared from the path. The exact sequence of moves would need to be refined to ensure the red car can exit without any obstacles.
