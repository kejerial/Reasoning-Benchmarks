1. The red car (A) is currently at row 3, column 4.
2. The exit is at row 3, column 6.
3. The path to the exit is blocked by the car at row 3, column 5 (J).

First, we need to move the car at row 3, column 5 (J) to the right. We can do this by moving the car at row 2, column 5 (K) to the right, and then the car at row 1, column 5 (H) to the right.

Step 1: Move K right [K+1]
Step 2: Move H right [H+1]

Now, the car at row 3, column 5 (J) can move right [J+1].

Next, we need to move the car at row 2, column 4 (G) to the right to clear the path for the red car (A).

Step 3: Move G right [G+1]

Now, the red car (A) can move right [A+1].

Continuing this process, we need to move the car at row 1, column 4 (F) to the right.

Step 4: Move F right [F+1]

Now, the red car (A) can move right [A+1] again.

We continue this process until the red car (A) reaches the exit.

Step 5: Move A right [A+1]
Step 6: Move A right [A+1]
Step 7: Move A right [A+1]
Step 8: Move A right [A+1]

After these moves, the red car (A) will be at the exit.
