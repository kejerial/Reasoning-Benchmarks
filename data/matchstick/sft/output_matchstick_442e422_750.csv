Original equation is 2 + 3 = 9. 2 and 3 are correct, but 9 is incorrect. Let's see. If I move the upper-right segment from the '2' to the '9', making it a '3', then 3 + 3 = 6. Still not 9. Alternatively, if I move the upper-left segment from the '2' to the '9', making it a '1', then 1 + 3 = 4. Not 9. If I move the middle segment from the '2' to the '9', making it a '7', then 7 + 3 = 10. Not 9. If I move the lower-right segment from the '2' to the '9', making it a '5', then 5 + 3 = 8. Not 9. If I move the lower-left segment from the '2' to the '9', making it a '6', then 6 + 3 = 9. Bingo!

Original equation is 1 + 1 = 3. The 1s are correct, but 3 is incorrect. If I move the upper-right segment from the 3 to the first 1, making it a 7. Then 7 + 1 = 8. Still not 3. Alternatively, if I move the upper-left segment from the 3 to the first 1, making it a 7. Then 7 + 1 = 8. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the 3 to the first 1, making it a 0. Then 0 + 1 = 1. Still not 3. Alternatively, if I move the lower-right segment from the 3 to the first 1, making it a 6. Then 6 + 1 = 7. Still not 3. Alternatively, if I move the lower-left segment from the 3 to the first 1, making it a 9. Then 9 + 1 = 10. Still not 3. Alternatively, if I move the top segment from the 3 to the first 1, making it a 2. Then 2 + 1 = 3. That works. So move the top segment from the 3 to the first 1.

Original equation is 6 - 1 = 6. Let's check. 6 minus 1 is 5, not 6. So the equation is incorrect. Let's see how to fix it. The 6s and 1 are correct. The equals sign is fixed. So we need to adjust the left side to make 6 - 1 = 5. Alternatively, maybe make the right side 5. Let's see.
