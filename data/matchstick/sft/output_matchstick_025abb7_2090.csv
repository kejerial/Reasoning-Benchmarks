Original equation is 3 + 3 = 8. The 3s are correct, but 8 is incorrect. If I move the upper-right segment from the first 3 to the 8, making it a 9, then 3 + 3 = 9. Still not 8. Alternatively, if I move the upper-left segment from the first 3 to the 8, making it a 0. Then 0 + 3 = 3. Not helpful.

Original equation is 7 + 2 = 8. Let's check the segments. 7 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, bottom. 2 is top, upper-left, middle, lower-right. 8 is top, upper-left, middle, lower-left, bottom. If I can make the 8 from the 2. If I move the lower-right segment from the 2 to the 8. But 2 can't have that segment. Alternatively, if I can turn the 7 into a 1. If I remove the upper-right segment from the 7, it becomes 1. Then 1 + 2 = 3. Not 8. Alternatively, if I can turn the 8 into a 0. But 8 is already a 0. Wait, 8 is top, upper-left, middle, lower-left, bottom. If I remove the upper-left, middle, lower-left, bottom segments, that's a 0. But that would require removing multiple segments. Alternatively, if I can turn the 2 into a 3. If I add the lower-right segment to the 2. But we can't add segments. Alternatively, if I can turn the 7 into a 1. If I remove the upper-right segment from the 7, it becomes 1. Then 1 + 2 = 3. Not 8. Alternatively, if I can turn the 8 into a 5.

"9-4=9","1","9-4=5","N/A","<think>
Original equation is 9 - 4 = 9. 9 - 4 is 5, not 9. So the right side is wrong. Let's see. If I can change the 9 on the right to a 5. To do that, maybe take a segment from the 9. The 9 has top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. If I remove the upper-left segment, it becomes a 3. But that would make 9 - 4 = 3. Not helpful. If I remove the upper-right segment, it becomes a 2. 9 - 4 = 2. Still not. If I remove the middle segment, it becomes a 6. 9 - 4 = 6. Not correct. If I remove the lower-left segment, it becomes a 5. 9 - 4 = 5. Perfect. So moving the lower-left segment from the 9 to the 9 on the right would make it a 5. So the equation becomes 9 - 4 = 5. But that's not the answer. Wait, the original equation is 9 - 4 = 9. So if I change the right 9 to a 5, then 9 - 4 = 5. But the problem is to make the equation correct. So 9 - 4 = 5 is correct.
