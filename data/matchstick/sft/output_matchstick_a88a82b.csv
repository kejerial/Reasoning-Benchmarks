Original equation is 2 + 3 = 9. 2 is correct, 3 is correct, but 9 is incorrect. Let's see. If I move the upper-right segment from the '9' to the '2', making it a '3', then the equation becomes 3 + 3 = 9. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I move the upper-left segment from the '3' to the '9', making it a '1', but that would make 2 + 1 = 9, which is false. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the '9' to the '3', making it a '5', but that would make 2 + 5 = 9, which is false. Alternatively, if I move the lower-right segment from the '3' to the '9', making it a '7', but 2 + 7 = 9 is false. Alternatively, if I move the lower-left segment from the '3' to the '9', making it a '0', but 2 + 0 = 9 is false. Alternatively, if I move the top segment from the '3' to the '9', making it a '6', but 2 + 6 = 8. Not 9. Alternatively, if I move the upper-right segment from the '3' to the '9', making it a '5', but 2 + 5 = 7. Not 9. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the '3' to the '9', making it a '2', but 2 + 2 = 4. Not 9. Alternatively, if I move the lower-right segment from the '9' to the '3', making it a '7', but 2 + 7 = 9. Wait, 2 + 7 = 9 is correct. So if I move the lower-right segment from the '9' to the '3', making it a '7', then the equation becomes 2 + 7 = 9. That works. So move the lower-right segment from the '9' to the '3'.

Original equation is 7 + 2 = 8. Let's check the segments. 7 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-right, bottom. 2 is top, upper-left, middle, lower-left, lower-right. 8 is top, upper-left, middle, lower-right, bottom. If I can make the 2 into a 3 by moving a segment. If I take the lower-left from 2 and move it to the middle of 8, making it a 5. Then 7 + 3 = 10. Not helpful. Alternatively, take the lower-right from 2 and move it to the middle of 8. Then 7 + 5 = 12. Still not 8. Alternatively, take the upper-right from 7 and move it to the middle of 8. Then 6 + 2 = 8. That works. So move upper-right from 7 to middle of 8.

Original equation is 9 - 4 = 9. 9 - 4 is 5, not 9. So the right side is wrong. Let's see. If I can change the 9 on the right to a 5. To do that, maybe take a segment from the 9. The 9 has top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. If I remove the upper-left segment, it becomes a 3. Then 9 - 4 = 3. Still not 5.

Original equation is 6 - 1 = 6. Let's check. 6 minus 1 is 5, not 6. So the right side should be 5. To fix, we can move a matchstick from the 6 on the right to the 6 on the left. If we remove the upper-right segment from the right 6, it becomes a 0. Then the equation is 6 - 1 = 0. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if we remove the upper-left segment from the left 6, it becomes a 9. Then 9 - 1 = 8. Still not 5. Alternatively, if we remove the middle segment from the left 6, it becomes a 0.
