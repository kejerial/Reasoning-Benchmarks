Original equation is 3 + 3 = 8. The 3s are correct, but 8 is incorrect. If I move the upper-right segment from the first 3 to the 8, making it a 9, then 3 + 3 = 9. Still not 8. Alternatively, if I move the upper-left segment from the first 3 to the 8, making it a 0, but 0 is not a valid digit. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the 8 to the 3, making it a 5, but that would be 3 + 5 = 8. Wait, that works. So move the middle segment from the 8 to the first 3. Then 3 + 5 = 8. So the answer is 3 + 5 = 8.

Original equation is 9 - 6 = 9. 9 - 6 is 3, not 9. So the equation is incorrect. Let's see how to fix it. The 9s and 6 can be modified. The 6 is made with top, upper-left, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. If we remove the upper-left segment, it becomes a 9. So 9 - 9 = 0. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if we remove the lower-right segment from the 6, it becomes a 0. Then 9 - 0 = 9. That works. So moving the lower-right segment from the 6 to the 9.

Original equation is 1 + 1 = 3. The 3 is incorrect. The 3 is made of 5 segments. If I remove the top segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. Then 1 + 1 = 5. Not 3. If I remove the upper-right segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. If I remove the middle segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. If I remove the lower-right segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. If I remove the lower-left segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. If I remove the bottom segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. So no. Alternatively, maybe move a segment from the 3 to another digit.
