Alternatively, if I move the lower-left segment from the second 1 to the 3, making it a 0. Then 1 + 0 = 1. Not 3. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the second 1 to the 3, making it a 2. Then 1 + 2 = 3. That works. So moving the middle segment from the second 1 to the 3.

Original equation is 1 + 1 = 3. The 1s are correct, but 3 is incorrect. If I move the upper-right segment from the first 1 to the 3, making it a 7. Then 1 + 1 = 7. Still not 3. Alternatively, if I move the lower-right segment from the first 1 to the 3, making it a 9. Then 1 + 1 = 9. Not 3. Alternatively, if I move the upper-left segment from the first 1 to the 3, making it a 4. Then 1 + 1 = 4. Not 3. Alternatively, if I move the lower-left segment from the first 1 to the 3, making it a 0. Then 1 + 1 = 0. Not 3. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the first 1 to the 3, making it a 2.

Original equation is 7 + 2 = 8.

"9-4=9","1","9-4=5","N/A","<think>
Original equation is 9 - 4 = 9. That's incorrect. 9 - 4 = 5. So need to fix the right side to 5. The 9 on the right can be modified. If we remove the upper-right segment from the 9, it becomes a 6. Then 9 - 4 = 6. Still incorrect. If we remove the upper-left segment, it becomes a 1. 9 - 4 = 1. Still incorrect. If we remove the middle segment, it becomes a 0. 9 - 4 = 0. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-right segment, it becomes a 5. 9 - 4 = 5. That works. So move the lower-right segment from the 9 to the 5. But wait, the 5 is fixed. Wait, the 5 is part of the equation. Wait, the equation is 9 - 4 = 5. So the 5 is part of the equation. So we can't modify the 5. Therefore, we need to modify the 9 or the 4. Let's see. If we take the lower-right segment from the 9 and move it to the 4. The 4 is 4 segments: upper-left, middle, upper-right, lower-right. If we remove the lower-right segment, it becomes a 1. Then 9 - 1 = 5. That works. So move the lower-right segment from the 9 to the 4. So the equation becomes 9 - 1 = 5. Which is correct. So the answer is 9 - 1 = 5.

Original equation is 1 + 1 = 3. The left side is correct, but the right side is incorrect. The 3 is made of 5 segments. If we can turn it into a 2, which is 5 segments. So if we remove the upper-right segment from the 3, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 1 = 2. But that's not correct. Alternatively, if we remove the upper-left segment, it becomes a 1. 1 + 1 = 1. Still incorrect. If we remove the middle segment, it becomes a 7. 1 + 1 = 7. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-right segment, it becomes a 5. 1 + 1 = 5. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-left segment, it becomes a 6. 1 + 1 = 6. Still incorrect. If we remove the top segment, it becomes a 4. 1 + 1 = 4. Still incorrect. So none of these work. Alternatively, maybe the 1 on the left can be modified. The 1 is made of 2 segments: upper-right and lower-right. If we remove the upper-right segment, it becomes a 7. 7 + 1 = 8. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-right segment, it becomes a 1. 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. So perhaps the 3 is the problem. Let's see. If we take the upper-right segment from the 3 and move it to the 1 on the left. The 1 is upper-right and lower-right. If we add the upper-right segment, it becomes a 4. 4 + 1 = 5. Still incorrect. Alternatively, if we take the upper-right segment from the 3 and move it to the 1 on the right. The 1 is upper-right and lower-right. If we add the upper-right segment, it becomes a 4. 1 + 4 = 5.
