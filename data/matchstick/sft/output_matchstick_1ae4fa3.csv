Original equation is 3 + 3 = 8. Let's check the segments. 3 is 5 segments: top, upper-right, middle, lower-right, bottom. So 3 + 3 = 8. But 8 is 6 segments. So the equation is 3 + 3 = 8. But 3 + 3 is 6, not 8. So the equation is incorrect. How to fix it? Let's see. If I move a matchstick from the 3 on the left. If I remove the upper-right segment from the left 3, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 3 = 4. Still not 8. If I remove the middle segment from the left 3, it becomes a 5. Then 5 + 3 = 8. That works! So moving the middle segment from the left 3 to the right 3. So the corrected equation is 5 + 3 = 8.

Original equation is 1 + 4 = 9. Let's check the segments. 1 is top, upper-right, lower-right. 4 is upper-left, middle, upper-right, lower-right. 9 is top, upper-right, middle, lower-right, bottom. So the equation is 1 + 4 = 9. That's correct. So no matchsticks need moving.

Original equation is 1 + 7 = 5. Let's check the segments. 1 is top, upper-right, lower-right. 7 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. 5 is top, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. So the equation is 1 + 7 = 5. That's incorrect. Let's see if we can move a matchstick to make it correct. Let's try moving a matchstick from the 7. If we remove the upper-left segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then the equation is 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the upper-right segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the middle segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-left segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-right segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the bottom segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the top segment from the 7, it becomes a 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. So moving a matchstick from the 7 doesn't help. Let's try moving a matchstick from the 5. If we remove the top segment from the 5, it becomes a 3. Then 1 + 7 = 3. Still incorrect. If we remove the upper-left segment from the 5, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 7 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the upper-right segment from the 5, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 7 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the middle segment from the 5, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 7 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-left segment from the 5, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 7 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-right segment from the 5, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 7 = 2. Still incorrect. If we remove the bottom segment from the 5, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 7 = 2. Still incorrect. So moving a matchstick from the 5 doesn't help. Let's try moving a matchstick from the 1. If we remove the top segment from the 1, it becomes a 7. Then 7 + 7 = 14. Still incorrect. If we remove the upper-right segment from the 1, it becomes a 7. Then 7 + 7 = 14. Still incorrect. If we remove the lower-right segment from the 1, it becomes a 7. Then 7 + 7 = 14. Still incorrect. If we remove the bottom segment from the 1, it becomes a 7. Then 7 + 7 = 14. Still incorrect. So moving a matchstick from the 1 doesn't help. So perhaps the equation is already correct? Let's check: 1 + 7 = 8. But 8 is a valid digit. Wait, 8 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. So 1 + 7 = 8. That's correct. So no matchsticks need moving.

Original equation is 7 + 2 = 8. Let's check the segments. 7 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. 2 is top, upper-right, middle, lower-right. 8 is top, upper-right, middle, lower-left, bottom. So 7 + 2 = 8. That's correct. So no matchsticks need moving.

Original equation is 1 + 1 = 3. The left side is correct, but the right side is 3. If I move a matchstick from the 3 to the 1, but 3 is a 3. If I remove the top segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. Then 1 + 1 = 5. Still not 3. If I remove the upper-right segment from the 3, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still not 3. If I remove the middle segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. 1 + 1 = 5. Not 3. If I remove the lower-right segment from the 3, it becomes a 7. 1 + 1 = 7. Not 3. If I remove the lower-left segment from the 3, it becomes a 6. 1 + 1 = 6. Not 3. If I remove the bottom segment from the 3, it becomes a 9. 1 + 1 = 9. Not 3. If I remove the top segment from the 3, it becomes a 5. 1 + 1 = 5. Not 3. If I remove the upper-left segment from the 3, it becomes a 2. 1 + 1 = 2. Not 3. If I remove the middle segment from the 1, it becomes a 7. 7 + 1 = 8. Not 3. If I remove the upper-right segment from the 1, it becomes a 1. 1 + 1 = 2. Not 3. If I remove the lower-right segment from the 1, it becomes a 7. 7 + 1 = 8. Not 3. If I remove the lower-left segment from the 1, it becomes a 6. 6 + 1 = 7. Not 3. If I remove the bottom segment from the 1, it becomes a 9. 9 + 1 = 10. Not 3. If I remove the top segment from the 1, it becomes a 5. 5 + 1 = 6. Not 3. If I remove the upper-left segment from the 1, it becomes a 2. 2 + 1 = 3. Yes! So moving the upper-left segment from the 1 to the 3 would make it a 2. Then 2 + 1 = 3. So the answer is 2 + 1 = 3.

Original equation is 9 - 4 = 9. That's incorrect. 9 - 4 = 5. So we need to adjust the equation to make it correct. Let's see. The 9 on the left can be changed. If we remove the upper-right segment from the 9, it becomes a 6. Then 6 - 4 = 2. Still not 9. If we remove the lower-right segment from the 9, it becomes a 5. 5 - 4 = 1. Not 9.

Original equation is 6 - 1 = 6. Let's check: 6 - 1 is 5, not 6. So the equation is incorrect. Let's see how to fix it. The 6 on the left is correct. The 1 is correct. The 6 on the right is incorrect. So we need to change the 6 on the right to a 5. How? The 6 is made with top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right. To make a 5, we need to remove the lower-left segment. So if we remove the lower-left segment from the 6 on the right, it becomes a 5. Then the equation becomes 6 - 1 = 5, which is correct. So move the lower-left segment from the rightmost 6 to the rightmost 6, turning it into a 5.
