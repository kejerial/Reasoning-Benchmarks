"7+2=8","1","7+2=9","N/A","<think>
Original equation is 7 + 2 = 8. Let's check the segments. 7 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, bottom. 2 is top, upper-right, middle, lower-right. 8 is top, upper-left, upper-right, middle, lower-left, lower-right, bottom. If I can make the 8 from the 2. If I move the lower-right segment from the 2 to the 7. Wait, 7 is already lit. If I remove the lower-right segment from the 2, it becomes a 3. Then 7 + 3 = 10. Not helpful. Alternatively, if I move the upper-right segment from the 2 to the 7. But 7 already has upper-right lit. So moving it would make it a 1. 1 + 2 = 3. Not helpful. Alternatively, if I move the middle segment from the 2 to the 7. Then 7 becomes 5. 5 + 2 = 7. Still not 8. Alternatively, if I move the lower-left segment from the 2 to the 7. Then 7 becomes 6. 6 + 2 = 8. Yes! So move the lower-left segment from the 2 to the 7. Then the equation is 6 + 2 = 8. Correct.

Original equation is 1 + 1 = 3. The 3 is incorrect. Let's see. The 3 is made of top, upper-right, middle, lower-right, bottom. If I remove the upper-right segment, it becomes a 2. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Still incorrect. If I remove the middle segment, it becomes a 5. 1 + 1 = 5. Still incorrect. If I remove the lower-right segment, it becomes a 0. 1 + 1 = 0. Not helpful. Alternatively, if I move the upper-right segment from the 3 to the first 1. The first 1 is made of top, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right. If I remove upper-right, it becomes a 7.
