# Reasoning-Benchmarks/keyword_analysis

## Purpose

The keyword analysis aims to:
- Quantify the occurrence of specific reasoning-related keywords or phrases in model-generated outputs.
- Categorize responses according to predefined keyword clusters (e.g., reasoning types, cognitive theories).
- Support interpretability analyses of language model outputs across different models or evaluation subsets.

## Expected contents

This directory may include:
- Python scripts for keyword extraction or frequency analysis.
- Keyword definition files (e.g., JSON or TXT lists of terms).
- CSV or JSON files reporting keyword counts or mappings.
- Visualizations (e.g., bar charts of keyword frequencies).
- Intermediate or final analysis results.
